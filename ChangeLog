ufw-frontends
Version 0.3.0
09-06-2011


New Features:

* View ufw log entries from within ufw-frontends (Events tab).
  The entries in the Events tab are parsed directly from the ufw log.
  New events are shown as soon as they appear in the ufw log.
  This feature requires Pyinotify.

* Create rules based on the list of events in the event log.
  You can use this feature to allow blocked connections.

* Add support for more IPT modules specifically:
  - nf_conntrack_ftp and nf_nat_ftp (for FTP)
  - nf_conntrack_irc and nf_nat_irc (for IRC)
  - nf_conntrack_sane (for saned)


Fixed bugs:

* Issue 15: bug when ufw has no ipt_modules configured
